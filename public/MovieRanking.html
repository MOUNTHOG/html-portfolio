<h1>FAVOURITE MOVIES ACCORDING TO MOUNTHOG</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr >
 
<h3>Avengers Endgame</h3>
<p>Its one of the highest gorssing films ever made in the histroy of cinemas. The reason why I liked is because its science fiction and superhero stuff with an action pack thriller. Also it highlights the fact that to acomplish something great one must make sacrifices</p>

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
 
<p>Made in late 1900s it is still a very likeable fim even today because of its timeless story of time travel and adventure. The three parts are well connected and does not confuse one also ending on a good note. It is still source of inspiration for various science fiction movies</p>

<h3>Sholay</h3>

<p>It is considered as one of the gems of Indian film industry. It is combined with all types of elements which one can expect from a movie. Many of its dailogue and songs still have a huge cult following.</p>
